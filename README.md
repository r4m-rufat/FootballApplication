# FootballApplication

# Why app was not edited!
Diana didn't send me an application drive link because she forgot it. During this time I think that in the task unfinished project doesn't play a special role. For this reason I started to write this application from zero. But when I ask Diana about this application, she said me: "I forget to send you unfinished application link" and sent it to me. But in this time it is late for that. Because I finished this project. I hope that you take into consideration. That is why I didn't edit this project and I think that you will appreciate my project, code structure which has wrote new technolgies. 

# About your questions!
I have used in this project new technologies Jetpack Compose for designing ui, Dagger-Hilt for Dependency Injection, Coroutines for asynchronous work, MVVM architecture, Retrofit2. If I have a free time I would like to change the design firstly. Wonderful design is impossible in short time.
